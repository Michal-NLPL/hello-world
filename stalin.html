  <h2><strong>
    It’s all about politics. How to manipulate memory in Soviet Russia and Classical Athens?
  </strong></h2>
  
  <p> In the spring of 1937, Joseph Stalin and the most important officials of the Soviet Russia triumphally visited 
  the canal Moscow-Volga under construction. One of these figures was Nikolai Yezhov – the head of the NKVD, so-called 'Bloody Dwarf", 
  resposible for Stalinist purges. </p>
    
  <img src ="files/stalin-jezow.jpg">
    
 <p> Fallen out of the dictator’s favour and considered to be an enemy of the nation, Yezhov was executed 
  two years later. <strong>He was not only eliminated in a physical sense, Yezov got literally deleted from the photo</strong> 
  Above we can see the famous pair of photos: the former was taken in 1937, the latter was distributed after Yezhov’s death. 
  Also, the former NKVD head was removed from the propaganda film footage, school handbooks and many photographs. 
  </p>
 
 <p>
   But why on earth Stalin and the photo when the website is about Athens and a stone?
   The practice of manipulation of memory has not started recently. It was a common phenomenon; even in Classical Athens we find examples
   telling us how the manipulation of memory worked. Let us go to this remote place where an interesting
   <br>inscription reveals events parallel to our modern times. 
  
  <h2>Memory and Tyrants in Classical Athens</h2>
  <p>
    In the end of the fifth century BC, a group of inhabitants of Thasos was granted a 
    special political honour by the Athenians. They are called <em>proxenoi</em> - this office can be compared 
    to a modern honorary consul. The inscriptions informs us that the original decree on which the honour of proxenia 
    was written was destroyed by ‘the Thirty’. ‘Thirty Tyrants’ denotes the group of oligarchs ruling Athens in 404-403 B.C; 
    they seized control of the city after the failure of the Athens in the Peloponnesian War. From the other epigraphical material 
    we know that the tyrants participated in destruction of other honourary inscriptions. 
    By doing so, they tried to invalidate the legal decision and to erase the memory on those they considered enemies. 
  </p>
 <p>
The inscription clearly illustrates that power tends to manipulate memory – regardless of an epoch. What differs is a from of 
   that manipulaton. Yezhof was removed from the picture, the Thasians's inscription was literally destroyed. In both cases the purpose 
   was the same - to forget.
